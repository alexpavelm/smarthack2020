Eating. Redefined.

A Flutter application designed to make food retail easier. The idea consists of personalized plans that you choose and customize right from the confort of your home, without ever going to the grocery shop again. Just subscribe to packs that fit you best, and leave the rest to us. We'll make sure to mix it up every week to keep it fresh and to give you a varied diet.

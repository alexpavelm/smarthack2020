## Eating. Redefined.

A Flutter application designed to help people with Alzheimer, by always keeping their family close. Conceptually speaking, the "care-taker" would directly connect to a "patient" by scanning a unique QR code. The care-takers would then be able to add tasks to the patient's daily routine, check on their mood, or even add posts to the memory lane.

A Flutter application designed to make food retail easier. The idea consists of personalized plans that you choose and customize right from the confort of your home, without ever going to the grocery shop again. Just subscribe to packs that fit you best, and leave the rest to us. We'll make sure to mix it up every week to keep it fresh and to give you a varied diet.
